# datascience-aiml-mapmatching
About my project:

This project aims to develop a map-matching algorithm that accurately distinguishes vehicular movement on highways and service roads. The algorithm leverages AI/ML techniques to achieve high precision in identifying vehicular trajectories, providing a robust solution for various transport and navigation applications.

Project Overview:

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an algorithm that can differentiate vehicle movement on different types of roads. We employed preprocessing and data filtering methods in Python and built a Decision Tree model in R to classify the vehicle type based on the features from the datasets.

Datasets:
Datasetlink:/www.kaggle.com/datasets/sravanichitrada03/vehicular-movements-datasets

Vehicle Path (Day) - Contains daily movement data of vehicles.
Geo1 - Includes geolocation data for path matching.
The target variable for this model is vehicle type.

Preprocessing and Data Filtering:

Preprocessing and data filtering were performed in Python to:
Clean and structure the data for analysis.
Remove noise and irrelevant features.
Prepare data for effective training and testing.


Model Development:

A Decision Tree model was developed in R to classify vehicle movements effectively. The model was trained and tested on preprocessed datasets to enhance predictive accuracy in distinguishing road types.
